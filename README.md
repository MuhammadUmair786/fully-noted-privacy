**Introduction**
 
Welcome to FULLY NOTED.  At Giddee-Up Technologies LLC, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our small note-taking organizational application.
 
**Information We Collect**
 
1. **Local Data**: FULLY NOTED is designed to store all data locally on your device. We do not collect, access, or store any of your personal information, notes, or files on our servers. Your data remains under your control.
 
2. **Optional Email Storage**: You have the option to provide your email address for certain features, such as password recovery or synchronization. If you choose to provide your email address, it will be stored in Google Firebase for an undetermined length. We will only use your email address for the specific purposes you have consented to, and it will not be shared with third parties.
 
3. **Cloud Storage**: FULLY NOTED allows you to store your app's files in the cloud. Please note that when you choose to use cloud storage, Giddee-Up Technologies LLC assumes no responsibility for the retention, storage, or privacy of your data in the cloud. The use of cloud storage is subject to the terms and privacy policies of the cloud service provider you select. You are solely responsible for your data as bound by your chosen cloud producer's terms and conditions.
 
**Location Data**
 
FULLY NOTED does not collect, store, or access location data. The permission to access location in the background is used solely to check for the SSID of the currently active Wi-Fi network. This information is used to limit synchronization to user-configured Wi-Fi connections and is never used to determine your actual location or shared with any third-party entities.

Images and videos captured through the app are saved locally on your device and are not transmitted or stored on our servers.
